# Task 4: Cloud Integration and Application Completion
## Objective
Complete the Ahyaha blood donation application by integrating cloud storage and implementing full CRUD functionality for donors.

## Part 1: Backend as a Service (BaaS) Integration
In this part, you will integrate a cloud-based backend service to store and retrieve donor information.

### Requirements:
1. Choose and integrate either Firebase or Supabase as your BaaS solution
2. Implement the following cloud features:
   - Remote data storage for donors
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Proper error handling for network operations
3. Update the existing DonorRepository implementation to work with the cloud service
4. Ensure offline functionality with local caching

### Implementation Steps:
1. Configure BaaS Service
   
   - Set up project in Firebase Console or Supabase Dashboard
   - Add necessary dependencies to your project
   - Initialize the service in your application
2. Refactor Repository Layer
   
   - Create cloud data sources for donor information
   - Implement repository pattern with both local and remote data sources
   - Add proper synchronization logic
3. Update ViewModels
   
   - Modify existing ViewModels to handle asynchronous cloud operations
   - Add loading states and error handling

## Part 2: Complete Application Functionality
In this part, you will implement the remaining CRUD operations and search functionality for donors.

### Requirements:
1. Complete donor management features:
   
   - Create: Finish the Add Donor functionality
   - Read: Implement donor details view
   - Update: Add ability to edit existing donor information
   - Delete: Implement donor removal
2. Implement advanced search functionality:
   
   - Search by donor name
   - Filter by blood type (A, B, AB, O) and Rh factor (+/-)
   - Sort by location or last donation date

### Implementation Steps:
1. Complete Donor Management UI
   
   - Create edit donor screen
   - Add delete confirmation dialog
   - Implement donor detail view
2. Enhance Search Functionality
   
   - Create advanced search UI for blood donation context
   - Implement filter logic in ViewModel
   - Add sorting options relevant to blood donation
3. User Experience
   
   - Add loading indicators
   - Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add animations for smooth transitions

## Bonus Challenge: User Authentication and Authorization
### Requirements:
1. Implement user authentication:
   
   - Registration
   - Login/Logout
   - Password reset
2. Associate donors with user accounts:
   
   - Store user ID with each donor profile
   - Implement permissions (users can only edit/delete their own donor profile)
3. Add user profiles:
   
   - Profile information including donation history
   - Blood donation eligibility tracking
   - Donation reminders based on eligibility dates

### Implementation Steps:
1. Set Up Authentication
   
   - Configure auth providers in your BaaS
   - Create login and registration screens
   - Implement session management
2. Update Donor Logic
   
   - Modify donor model to include user ID
   - Update repositories to filter by user when appropriate
   - Add permission checks before edit/delete operations

## Deliverables
1. Fully functional blood donation application with cloud integration
2. Complete CRUD operations for donor management
3. Advanced search and filter functionality for finding donors by blood type
4. (Bonus) User authentication and donor profile management

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and architecture
- Proper implementation of cloud services
- User experience and interface design
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization

Good luck!
